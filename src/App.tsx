    <p>By day, I'm an English teacher for stage 5. I've worked in the American system; however, most of my experience is in the British system using Cambridge International Examination resources.</p>
    <p>I've enjoyed teaching and cultivating a bond with my students that makes learning fun and enjoyable. With all my strength, I think of fun and innovative ways to deliver the lesson everyday. </p>
